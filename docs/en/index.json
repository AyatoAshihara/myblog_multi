Another matter…\r\r\rHi. There are several ways to collect macroeconomic data, but collecting data for each country can be a challenge. However, you can automate the tedious process of collecting data from the OECD via API. Today, I will introduce the method.\n1.OECD.Stat Web API\rOECD.org offers a service called OECD.Stat, which provides a variety of economic data for OECD and certain non-member countries. You can also download the csv data manually by going to the website. Since OECD provides a web API, you only need to use Python or R to do this.\nBelow is a list of implementation details for specific OECD REST SDMX interfaces at this time.\n\rOnly anonymous queries are supported and there is no authentication.\n\rEach response is limited to 1,000,000 observations.\n\rThe maximum length of the request URL is 1000 characters.\n\rCross-origin requests are supported in the CORS header (see here for more information about CORS).\n\rErrors are not returned in the results, but HTTP status codes and messages are set according to the Web Service Guidelines.\n\rIf a nonexistent dataset is requested, 401 Unauthorized is returned.\n\rThe source (or Agency ID) parameter of the REST query is required, but the ALL keyword is supported.\n\rVersioning is not supported: the latest implementation version is always used.\n\rSorting of data is not supported.\n\rThe lastNObservations parameter is not supported.\n\rEven when dimensionAtObservation=AllDimensions is used, the observations follow a chronological (or import-specific) order.\n\rSearching for reference metadata is not supported at this time.\n\r\r\r2.pandasdmx\rThe Web API is provided in the form of sdmx-json. There is a useful package for using it in Python, which is called pandasdmx**. Here’s how to download the data.\nImport pandasdmx, pass OECD to Request method as an argument and create api.Request object.\rPass the query condition to the data method of the api.Request object, and download the data of sdmx-json format from OECD.org.\rFormat the downloaded data into a pandas data frame with the method to_pandas().\r\r\r3.implementation\rLet’s do this in practice. What we’ll get is the **Revisions Analysis Dataset -- Infra-annual Economic Indicators**, one of the OECD datasets, the Monthly Ecnomic Indicator (MEI). We have access to all data, including revisions to the preliminary data on key economic variables (such as gross domestic product and its expenditure items, industrial production and construction output indices, balance of payments, composite key indicators, consumer price index, retail trade volume, unemployment rate, number of workers, hourly wages, money supply, and trade statistics), as first published You can see everything from data to confirmed data with corrections. The dataset provides a snapshot of data that were previously available for analysis in the Leading Economic Indicators database at monthly intervals beginning in February 1999. In other words, the dataset allows us to build predictive models based on the data available at each point in time. The most recent data is useful, but it is preliminary and therefore subject to uncertainty. The problem is that this situation cannot be replicated when backtesting, and the analysis is often done under a better environment than the actual operation. This is the so-called Jagged Edge problem. In this dataset, we think it is very useful because we can reproduce the situation of actual operation. This time, you will get the following data items.\n\r\rIndicators\rStatistical ID\rFrequency\r\r\r\rGross Domestic Product\r101\rQuarterly\r\rIndex of Industrial Production\r201\rMonthly\r\rRetail Trade Volume\r202\rMonthly\r\rMonetary Aggregates\r601\rMonthly\r\rInternational Trade in Goods\r702+703\rMonthly\r\rBalance of Payments\r701\rQuarterly\r\rEmployment\r502\rMonthly\r\rHarmonised Unemployment Rates\r501\rMonthly\r\rHourly Earnings in Manufacturing\r503\rMonthly\r\rEarly Estimates of Unit Labor Cost\r504\rQuarterly\r\rProduction of Construction\r203\rMonthly\r\r\r\rFirst, we define the functions.

This is very much appreciated as it is provided in Long format, which is also easy to visualize and regress. Here’s a visualization of the industrial production index as it is updated.\nimport seaborn as sns\rimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\rimport pandas as pd\rresult = result[result[\u0026#39;FREQUENCY\u0026#39;]==\u0026#39;M\u0026#39;]\rresult[\u0026#39;TIME_PERIOD\u0026#39;] = pd.to_datetime(result[\u0026#39;TIME_PERIOD\u0026#39;],format=\u0026#39;%Y-%m\u0026#39;)\rsns.relplot(data=result[lambda df: (df.VAR==\u0026#39;201\u0026#39;) \u0026amp; (pd.to_numeric(df.EDI) \u0026gt; 202004)],x=\u0026#39;TIME_PERIOD\u0026#39;,y=\u0026#39;value\u0026#39;,hue=\u0026#39;LOCATION\u0026#39;,kind=\u0026#39;line\u0026#39;,col=\u0026#39;EDI\u0026#39;)\r## \u0026lt;seaborn.axisgrid.FacetGrid object at 0x00000000316BC3C8\u0026gt;\rplt.show()\rWhile we can see that the line graphs are depressed as the economic damage from the corona increases, there have been subtle but significant revisions to the historical values from preliminary to confirmed.

Another matter…\rPython 3 エンジニア認定データ分析試験に合格しました。合格率70%だけあって、かなり簡単でしたがPythonを基礎から見返すいい機会になりました。今やっている業務ではデータ分析はおろかPythonやRを使う機会すらないので、転職も含めた可能性を考えています。とりあえず、以下の資格を今年度中に取得する予定で、金融にこだわらずにスキルを活かせるポストを探していこうと思います。ダイエットと同じで宣言して自分を追い込まないと。。。\nI passed the Python 3 Engineer Certification Data Analysis exam. It was pretty easy, with only a 70% pass rate, but it was a good opportunity to revisit the basics of Python.

What I want to do\rWhat I’m going to show you is pre-processing (and analysis) using the Tick data of the exchange rate, as I mentioned above. I won’t go into the details of this article because my main focus is to improve efficiency using Rcpp, but I will briefly describe what I want to do first. I will not go into details, but I will show what we want to do in a nutshell first.\nWhat we want to do is to detect a Jump from the five-minute incremental return of the JPY/USD rate. Here, a jump is the point at which the exchange rate has risen (fallen) sharply compared to the previous rate. During the day, the exchange rate moves in small increments, but when there is an event, it rises (or falls) significantly. It is very interesting to see what kind of event causes the jump. In order to test this, we first need to detect jumps. The following paper is a reference point.\nSuzanne S. Lee \u0026amp; Per A. Mykland, 2008. “Jumps in Financial Markets: A New Nonparametric Test and Jump Dynamics,” Review of Financial Studies, Society for Financial Studies, vol. 21(6), pages 2535-2563, November.\nIt is a very well-respected paper with 204 Citation. We will scratch out the estimation method. First, let the continuous compound return be \\(d\\log S(t)\\) for \\(t\u0026gt;0\\). where \\(S(t)\\) is the price of the asset at \\(t\\). If there are no jumps in the market, \\(S(t)\\) is assumed to follow the following stochastic process\n\\[\rd\\log S(t) = \\mu(t)dt + \\sigma(t)dW(t) \\tag{1}\r\\]\nwhere \\(W(t)\\) is the standard Brownian motion, \\(\\mu(t)\\) is the drift term, and \\(\\sigma(t)\\) is the spot volatility. Also, when there is a Jump, \\(S(t)\\) is assumed to follow the following stochastic process\n\\[\rd\\log S(t) = \\mu(t)dt + \\sigma(t)dW(t) + Y(t)dJ(t) \\tag{2}\r\\]\nwhere \\(J(t)\\) is a counting process independent of \\(W(t)\\). 1 \\(Y(t)\\) represents the size of the jump and is a predictable process.\nNext, consider the logarithmic return of \\(S(t)\\). That is, \\(\\log S(t_i)/S(t_{i-1})\\), which follows a normal distribution \\(N(0, \\sigma(t_i))\\). 2Now, we define the statistic \\(\\mathcal{L(i)}\\) at \\(t_i\\) when there is a jump from \\(t_{i-1}\\) to \\(t_{i}\\) as follows.\n\\[\r\\mathcal{L(i)} \\equiv \\frac{|\\log S(t_i)/S(t_{i-1})|}{\\hat{\\sigma}_{t_i}} \\tag{3}\r\\]\nIt is a simple standardization of the absolute value of the log return, but uses the “Realized Bipower Variation” defined below as an estimator of the standard deviation.\n\\[\r\\hat{\\sigma}_{t_i} = \\frac{1}{K-2}\\sum_{j=i-K+2}^{i-2}|\\log S(t_j)/\\log S(t_{j-1})||\\log S(t_{j-1})/\\log S(t_{j-2})| \\tag{4}\r\\]\n\\(K\\) is the number of sample sizes contained in the Window. If we use a return in 5-minute increments and the jump occurs at 10:00 on 9/10/2020, and \\(K=270\\), then we will calculate using samples from the previous day, 9/9/2020 11:30 to 9/11/2020 09:55. What we’re doing is adding up the absolute value of the return multiplied by the absolute value of the return, which seems to make it difficult for the estimate of the next instant after the jump occurs (i.e., \\(t_{i+1}\\) and so on) to be affected by the jump. Incidentally, \\(K=270\\) is introduced in another paper as a recommended value for returns in 5-minute increments.\nLet us move on to how the calculated jump statistic \\(\\mathcal{L(i)}\\) is used in the statistical test to detect jumps. This is done by considering the maximum value of the random variable \\(\\mathcal{L(i)}\\) (also a random variable), and if it deviates significantly from that distribution (like 95% of points), the return of the statistic is the jump.\nIf there is no Jump in the period \\([t_{i-1},t_{i}]\\), then with the length of this period \\(\\Delta=t_{i}-t_{i-1}\\) approached to \\(0\\), i.e., \\(\\Delta\\rightarrow0\\), the sample maximum of the absolute value of the standard normal variable converges to the Gumbel distribution. Thus, Jump can reject and detect the null hypothesis when the following conditions are met\n\\[\r\\mathcal{L(i)} \u0026gt; G^{-1}(1-\\alpha)S_{n} + C_{n} \\tag{5}\r\\]\nwhere \\(G^{-1}(1-\\alpha)\\) is the \\((1-\\alpha)\\) quantile function of the standard Gumbell distribution. If \\(\\alpha=10%\\), \\(G^{-1}(1-\\alpha)=2.25\\). Note that (We won’t derive it, but we can prove it using equations 1 and 2)\n\\[\rS_{n} = \\frac{1}{c(2\\log n)^{0.5}} \\\\\rC_{n} = \\frac{(2\\log n)^{0.5}}{c}-\\frac{\\log \\pi+\\log(\\log n)}{2c(2\\log n)^{0.5}}\r\\]\nwhere \\(c=(2/\\pi)^{0.5}\\) and \\(n\\) is the total sample size used for estimation.\rFinally, \\(Jump_{t_i}\\) is calculated by\n\\[\rJump_{t_i} = \\log\\frac{S(t_i)}{S(t_{i-1})}×I(\\mathcal{L(i)} - G^{-1}(1-\\alpha)S_{n} + C_{n})\\tag{6}\r\\]\nwhere \\(I(⋅)\\) is an Indicator function that returns 1 if the content is greater than 0 and 0 otherwise.\n\r1. Loading data\rSo now that we know how to estimate, let’s load the Tick data first. The data is csv from QuantDataManager and saved in a working directory.\nlibrary(magrittr)\r# Read Tick data\rstrPath \u0026lt;- r\u0026quot;(C:\\Users\\hogehoge\\JPYUSD_Tick_2011.csv)\u0026quot;\rJPYUSD \u0026lt;- readr::read_csv(strPath)\rOn an unrelated note, I recently upgraded R to 4.0.2, and I’m quite happy to say that with 4.0 and above, you can escape the strings made by Python, which relieves some of the stress I’ve been experiencing.\nThe data looks like the following: in addition to the date, the Bid value, Ask value and the volume of transactions are stored. Here, we use the 2011 tick. The reason for this is to cover the dollar/yen at the time of the Great East Japan Earthquake.\nsummary(JPYUSD)\r## DateTime Bid Ask Volume ## Min. :2011-01-03 07:00:00 Min. :75.57 Min. :75.58 Min. : 1.00 ## 1st Qu.:2011-03-30 15:09:23 1st Qu.:77.43 1st Qu.:77.44 1st Qu.: 2.00 ## Median :2011-06-15 14:00:09 Median :80.40 Median :80.42 Median : 2.00 ## Mean :2011-06-22 05:43:11 Mean :79.91 Mean :79.92 Mean : 2.55 ## 3rd Qu.:2011-09-09 13:54:51 3rd Qu.:81.93 3rd Qu.:81.94 3rd Qu.: 3.00 ## Max. :2011-12-30 06:59:59 Max. :85.52 Max. :85.54 Max. :90.00\rBy the way, DateTime includes the period from 07:00:00 on 2011/1/3 to 06:59:59 on 2011-12-30 (16:59:59 on 2011-12-30) in Japan by UTC. The sample size is approximately 12 million entries.\nNROW(JPYUSD)\r## [1] 11946621\r\r2. Preprocessing\rThen calculate the median value from Bid and Ask and take the logarithm to calculate the return later.\n# Calculate the median value of Ask and Bid and make it logarithmic (for calculating the logarithmic return).\rJPYUSD \u0026lt;- JPYUSD %\u0026gt;% dplyr::mutate(Mid = (Ask+Bid)/2) %\u0026gt;% dplyr::mutate(logMid = log(Mid))\rI format the currently irregularly arranged trading data into 5-minute increments of returns. The way to do it is:\nCreate a POSIXct vector with 1 year chopped every 5 minutes.\rcreate a function that calculates the logarithmic return from the first and last sample in the window of 5min in turn, if you pass 1. as an argument.\rexecute. This is the plan. First, create the vector of 1.\r\r# Create POSIX vector to calculate returns in 5min increments (288 x days)\rstart \u0026lt;- as.POSIXct(\u0026quot;2011-01-02 22:00:00\u0026quot;,tz=\u0026quot;UTC\u0026quot;)\rend \u0026lt;- as.POSIXct(\u0026quot;2011-12-31 21:55:00\u0026quot;,tz=\u0026quot;UTC\u0026quot;)\rfrom \u0026lt;- seq(from=start,to=end,by=5*60)\rThen, let’s move on to 2. If you have 12 million data, even if you use purrr::map or apply with R, it takes a long time to call a function and it’s quite inefficient. I tried to use sapply, but it didn’t complete the process and it was forced to terminate. RCCp is useful in such a case. Although R has many very useful functions for graphs and statistics, it is not very good at large repetition, including calls to user-defined functions (because it is a scripting language, rather than a compiling language, I mean). So, I write the part of repetitive process in C++ and compile it as R function using Rcpp and execute it. It is very efficient to compile and visualize the results and write them in R. Also, Rccp helps you to write C++ in a similar way to R with less sense of discomfort. I think the following will give you a good idea of the details. It’s pretty well organized and is God, to say the least.\nRcpp for everyone\nNow, let’s write the code for the second step. In coding, I used articles on the net for reference.

After that, for some reason, the yen moved higher and peaked at 19:00. It is said that the yen is a safe asset, but this is the only time it is not safe given the heightened uncertainty.\n\r5. Summary\rI introduced the use of Rcpp to improve the efficiency of R analysis. The C++ is much faster than R even if you write the code honestly, so it is hard to make coding mistakes. The C++ is much faster than R even if you write the code in a simple way. Also, even if a compile error occurs, RStudio gives you a clue as to where the compile error is occurring, so there is no stress in that respect either, which is why I recommend it.\n\r\rA stochastic process with non-negative, integer, non-decreasing values.↩︎\n\rThe mean is not necessarily zero, depending on the shape of the drift term, but we are assuming a small enough drift term now.

In the last post, I built a model to predict the order of a racehorse using CNN based on its body image. The results were not so good, and we needed to refine our analysis, especially when we analyzed the factors using shap values, we found that the horses responded more to the stables in the background than to their bodies. This time, I would like to re-analyze the background from the horse’s body photo using Pytorch pre-trained model, and analyze the photo with only the horse’s body.\n1.

Here, \\(N\\) is assumed to be the number of images and \\(H\\) and \\(W\\) are assumed to be at least 224 pixels. The images need to be scaled to a range of [0, 1] and then normalized using the mean value = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406] and the standard value = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225].

What is “Backtesting”?\r2. Backtesting overfits.\r3. What is the distribution that the Sharpe ratio follows?\r4. Trying to derive the minimum backtest length\r4. At the end\r\r\r1. What is “Backtesting”?\rBacktesting is an algorithmic historical simulation of an investment strategy. Backtesting uses an algorithm to calculate the gains and losses that would have been incurred if the investment strategy you have drafted had been implemented over a period of time. Common statistics that evaluate the performance of an investment strategy, such as the Sharpe ratio and the information ratio, are used. Investors typically examine these back-testing statistics to determine asset allocation to the best performing investment (management) strategies, so asset managers do trial-and-error back-testing of a bloody number of times for good performance and present customer by that materials.\nFrom an investor’s perspective, it is important to distinguish between in-sample (IS) and out-of-sample (OOS) performance of a back-tested investment strategy; IS performance is defined as the sample used to design the investment strategy (referred to in the machine learning literature as the “training period” or “training set”) It is what is called “OOS”) simulated in a sample (aka “test set”). OOS performance, on the other hand, is simulated on a sample (aka “test set”) that was not used to design the investment strategy. Since backtesting predicts the effectiveness of an investment strategy with its performance, it can be guaranteed to be reproducible and realistic if the IS performance matches the OOS performance. However, it is difficult to judge whether the backtest is reliable when you receive it because the results of the out-sample are future results. It cannot be called a pure out-sample as long as the results of the OOS can be fed back to improve the strategy.\nSo, when you receive a backtest with good results from a fund manager, it is very important that you manage to assess how realistic the simulation is. It is also important for fund managers to understand the uncertainty of their own backtesting results. In this post, we will look at how to evaluate the realism of a backtesting simulation and what to look out for in order to ensure a repeatable backtest.\n\r2. Backtesting overfits.\rBailey, Borwein, López de Prado and Zhu (2015), which shows that any financial time series can be used to backtest We argue that it is (relatively) easy to overfit (overlearn) a simulation. Here, overfitting is a machine learning concept that describes a situation in which the model focuses on specific observational data (IS data) rather than on the general structure.\nBailey et. al. (2015) cite a situation where the backtesting results of a stock strategy are not good as an example of this claim. As the name implies, backtesting uses historical data, so it is possible to identify specific stocks that are experiencing losses and design the trading system to improve performance by adding some parameters to remove recommendations for those stocks ( (a technique known as “data snooping”). With a few repetitions of the simulation, you can derive “optimal parameters” that benefit from characteristics that are present in a particular sample but may be rare in the population.\nThere is a vast accumulation of research in the machine learning literature to address the problem of overfitting. But Bailey et. al. (2015) argue that the methods proposed in the context of machine learning are generally not applicable to multiple investment problems. The reasons for this seem to be the following four points.\nMachine learning methods to prevent overfitting require explicit point estimates and confidence intervals in the domain in which the event is defined in order to assess the explanatory power and quality of the prediction, because few investment strategies make such explicit predictions.\n\r“The E-mini S\u0026amp;P 500 is predicted to close around 1,600 with one standard deviation of 5 points at Friday’s close,” for example, but rather qualitative recommendations such as “buy” or “strong buy” are typically provided. Moreover, these forecasts do not have an explicit expiration date and are subject to change in the event of an unexpected event. On the other hand, the quantitative forecast is stated as Friday’s close.\r\reven if a particular investment strategy relies on a prediction formula, other components of the investment strategy may be overfitted.\n\rIn other words, there are many ways to overfit an investment strategy other than simply adjusting the prediction equation.\r\rbecause the methods of regression overfitting are parametric and involve many assumptions about data that are unobservable in the case of finance.\n\rbecause some methods do not control for the number of trials.\n\r\rBailey et. al. (2015) show that a comparatively low number of trials is needed to identify investment strategies with relatively poor backtesting performance. Think of the number of trials here as the number of trials and errors. It also calculates the minimum backtest length (MinBTL), which is the length of the backtest required for the number of trials. In this paper, the Sharpe ratio is always used to evaluate performance, but it can be applied to other performance measures as well. Let’s take a look at what it does.\n\r3. What is the distribution that the Sharpe ratio follows?\rTo derive the MinBTL, we first derive the (asymptotic) distribution of the Sharpe ratio. To begin with, the design of an investment strategy usually starts with the prior knowledge or belief that a particular pattern may help to predict the future value of a financial variable. For example, if you are aware of the lead-lag effect between bonds of different maturities, you can design a strategy that bets on a return to the equilibrium value if the yield curve rises. This model could take the form of a cointegration equation, a vector error correction model, or a system of stochastic differential equations.\nThe number of such model configurations (or trials) is vast, and fund managers naturally want to choose the one that maximizes the performance of their strategy, and to do so they conduct historical simulations (back testing) (see above). Backtesting evaluates the optimal sample size, frequency of signal updates, risk sizing, stop loss, maximum holding period, etc., in combination with other variables.\nThe Sharpe ratio used as a measure of performance assessment in this paper is a statistic that assesses the performance of a strategy based on a sample of historical returns, defined as the average excess return/standard deviation (risk) to BM. It is usually interpreted as “return to risk 1 standard deviation” and, depending on the asset class, if it is greater than 1, it can be considered a very good strategy. In the following, we will assume that the excess return \\(r_t\\) of a strategy is a random variable of i.i.d. and follows a normal distribution. That is, we assume that the distribution of \\(r_t\\) is independent of \\(r_s(t\\neq s)\\). It is not a very realistic assumption, though.\n\\[\rr_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\r\\]\rwhere \\(\\mathcal{N}\\) is the normal distribution of the mean \\(\\mu\\) and the variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). Now, the excess return \\(r_{t}(q)\\) at time t~t-q+1 is defined (I’m ignoring the compounding part.)\n\\[\rr_{t}(q) \\equiv r_{t} + r_{t-1} + ... + r_{t-q+1}\r\\]\rThen, the annualized Sharpe ratio is represented\n\\[\r\\begin{eqnarray}\rSR(q) \u0026amp;=\u0026amp; \\frac{E[r_{t}(q)]}{\\sqrt{Var(r_{t}(q))}}\\\\\r\u0026amp;=\u0026amp; \\frac{q\\mu}{\\sqrt{q}\\sigma}\\\\\r\u0026amp;=\u0026amp; \\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma}\\sqrt{q}\r\\end{eqnarray}\r\\]\nWe can express this as where \\(q\\) is the number (frequency) of returns per year. For example, \\(q=365\\) for daily returns (excluding leap years).\nThe true value of \\(SR\\) cannot be known because \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) are generally unknown. So, let \\(R_t\\) be the sample return and the risk-free rate \\(R^f\\)(constant), we calculate the estimated Sharpe ratio by the sample mean of \\(\\hat{\\mu}=1/T\\sum_{t=1}^T R_{t}-R^f\\) and the sample standard deviation of \\(\\hat{\\sigma}=\\sqrt{1/T\\sum_{t=1}^{T}(R_{t}-\\hat{\\mu})}\\) (where \\(T\\) is the sample size to be back-tested).\n\\[\r\\hat{SR}(q) = \\frac{\\hat{\\mu}}{\\hat{\\sigma}}\\sqrt{q}\r\\]\rAs an inevitable consequence, the calculation of \\(SR\\) is likely to be accompanied by considerable estimation errors. Now, let us derive the main topic of this section, the asymptotic distribution of \\(\\hat{SR}\\). First, since the asymptotic distributions of \\(\\hat{\\mu}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2\\) are finite and i.i.d., applying the central limit theorem derives\n\\[\r\\sqrt{T}\\hat{\\mu}\\sim^{a}\\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\sigma^2), \\\\\r\\sqrt{T}\\hat{\\sigma}^2\\sim^a\\mathcal{N}(\\sigma^2,2\\sigma^4)\r\\]\rince the Sharpe ratio is a random variable which is calculated from this \\(\\hat{\\mu}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2\\), let us denote this function as \\(g(\\hat{{\\boldsymbol \\theta}})\\) where \\(\\hat{{\\boldsymbol \\theta}}=(\\hat{\\mu},\\hat{\\sigma}^2)\\). Now, since it is i.i.d., \\(\\hat{{\\boldsymbol \\theta}}\\) is independent of each other, and, from the above discussion, the asymptotic joint distribution is written as\n\\[\r\\sqrt{T}\\hat{{\\boldsymbol \\theta}} \\sim^a \\mathcal{N}({\\boldsymbol \\theta},{\\boldsymbol V_{\\boldsymbol \\theta}})\r\\]\rwhere \\({\\boldsymbol V_{\\boldsymbol \\theta}}\\) is\n\\[\r{\\boldsymbol V_{\\boldsymbol \\theta}} = \\left( \\begin{array}{cccc}\r\\sigma^2 \u0026amp; 0\\\\\r0 \u0026amp; 2\\sigma^4\\\\\r\\end{array}\r\\right)\r\\]\rSince the sharp ratio estimates are now only a function of \\(g(\\hat{{\\boldsymbol \\theta}})\\) and \\(\\hat{{\\boldsymbol \\theta}}\\), from the delta method, the following\n\\[\r\\hat{SR} = g(\\hat{{\\boldsymbol \\theta}}) \\sim^a \\mathcal{N}(g({\\boldsymbol \\theta}),\\boldsymbol V_g)\r\\]\rasymptotically follows a normal distribution. where \\(\\boldsymbol V_g\\) is\n\\[\r\\boldsymbol V_g=\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial{\\boldsymbol \\theta}}{\\boldsymbol V_{\\boldsymbol \\theta}}\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial{\\boldsymbol \\theta}\u0026#39;}\r\\]\r\\(g({\\boldsymbol \\theta})=\\mu/\\sigma\\)なので、\rSince \\(g({\\boldsymbol \\theta})=\\mu/\\sigma\\), then\n\\[\r\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial{\\boldsymbol \\theta}\u0026#39;} = \\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc}\r\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\mu}\\\\\r\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\sigma^2}\\\\\r\\end{array}\r\\right]\r= \\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc}\r\\frac{1}{\\sigma}\\\\\r-\\frac{\\mu}{2\\sigma^3}\\\\\r\\end{array}\r\\right]\r\\]\rTherefore, you can derive\n\\[\r\\begin{eqnarray}\r\\boldsymbol V_g \u0026amp;=\u0026amp; \\left(\r\\begin{array}{cccc}\r\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\mu}, \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\sigma}\\\\\r\\end{array}\r\\right)\r\\left( \\begin{array}{cccc}\r\\sigma^2 \u0026amp; 0\\\\\r0 \u0026amp; 2\\sigma^4\\\\\r\\end{array}\r\\right)\r\\left(\r\\begin{array}{cccc}\r\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\mu}\\\\\r\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\sigma}\\\\\r\\end{array}\r\\right) \\\\\r\u0026amp;=\u0026amp; \\left(\r\\begin{array}{cccc}\r\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\mu}\\sigma^2, \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\sigma}2\\sigma^4\\\\\r\\end{array}\r\\right)\r\\left(\r\\begin{array}{cccc}\r\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\mu}\\\\\r\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\sigma}\\\\\r\\end{array}\r\\right) \\\\\r\u0026amp;=\u0026amp; (\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\mu})^2\\sigma^2 + (\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\sigma})^2\\sigma^4 \\\\\r\u0026amp;=\u0026amp; 1 + \\frac{\\mu^2}{2\\sigma^2} \\\\\r\u0026amp;=\u0026amp; 1 + \\frac{1}{2}SR^2\r\\end{eqnarray}\r\\]\rYou may need to be careful when you see good performance because the variance tends to be exponentially larger as the absolute value of the Sharpe ratio increases. Here’s the distribution that the annualized Sharpe ratio estimate \\(\\hat{SR}(q)\\) follows\n\\[\r\\hat{SR}(q)\\sim^a \\mathcal{N}(\\sqrt{q}SR,\\frac{V(q)}{T}) \\\\\rV(q) = q{\\boldsymbol V}_g = q(1 + \\frac{1}{2}SR^2)\r\\]\rNow, if \\(y\\) is the number of years of backtesting, we can write \\(T=yq\\) and use this to rewrite the above equation as follows (for a 3-year measurement with daily returns, the sample size \\(T\\) is \\(T=3×365=1095\\)).\n\\[\r\\hat{SR}(q)\\sim^a \\mathcal{N}(\\sqrt{q}SR,\\frac{1+\\frac{1}{2}SR^2}{y}) \\tag{1}\r\\]\rThe frequency \\(q\\) affects the mean of the Sharpe ratio, but not the variance. We can now derive an asymptotic distribution of the Sharpe ratio estimates. Now, what do we wanted to do with this? We were thinking about the reliability of the backtest. In other words, what is the probability that a backtest of \\(N\\) investment strategy ideas that FM twists and turns to develop a new product will produce a very high (good) value even though the true value of all of those Sharpe ratios is zero. In Bailey et. al. (2015), it was described as follows\nHow high is the expected maximum Sharpe ratio IS among a set of strategy configurations where the true Sharpe ratio is zero?\nWe also want to know how long you should be backtesting for in order to reduce the value of the expected maximum Sharpe ratio.\n\r4. Trying to derive the minimum backtest length\rThe situation we are considering now is that let \\(\\mu=0\\) and \\(y\\) 1 year for simplicity, then from equation (1) \\(\\hat{SR}(q)\\) follows the standard normal distribution \\(\\mathcal{N}(0,1)\\). Now, we will consider the expected value of the maximum value \\(\\max[\\hat{SR}]_N\\) of \\(\\hat{SR}_n(n=1,2,...N)\\), but as those with good instincts will have noticed, the discussion goes into the context of extreme value statistics. Since \\(\\hat{SR}_n\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,1)\\) is i.i.d., the extreme value distribution of that maximum statistic becomes Gumbel distribution from the Fisher-Tippett-Gnedenko theorem (sorry, I haven’t been able to follow the proof).\n\\[\r\\lim_{N\\rightarrow\\infty}prob[\\frac{\\max[\\hat{SR}]_N-\\alpha}{\\beta}\\leq x] = G(x) = e^{-e^{-x}}\r\\]\rwhere \\(\\alpha=Z(x)^{-1}[1-1/N], \\beta=Z(x)^{-1}[1-1/Ne^{-1}]-\\alpha\\), and \\(Z(x)\\) represents the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. The moment generating function of the Gumbel distribution \\(M_x(t)\\) is written as\n\\[\r\\begin{eqnarray}\rM_x(t) \u0026amp;=\u0026amp; E[e^{tx}] = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{tx}e^{-x}e^{-e^{-x}}dx \\\\\r\\end{eqnarray}\r\\]\rConverting variables with \\(x=-\\log(y)\\) gives \\(dx/dy=-1/y=-(e^{-x})^{-1}\\), so\n\\[\r\\begin{eqnarray}\rM_x(t) \u0026amp;=\u0026amp; \\int_{\\infty}^0-e^{-t\\log(y)}e^{-y}dy \\\\\r\u0026amp;=\u0026amp; \\int_{0}^\\infty y^{-t}e^{-y}dy \\\\\r\u0026amp;=\u0026amp; \\Gamma(1-t)\r\\end{eqnarray}\r\\]\rwhere \\(Gamma(x)\\) is a gamma function. From here, the expected value (mean) of the standardized maximum statistic is\n\\[\r\\begin{eqnarray}\r\\lim_{N\\rightarrow\\infty} E[\\frac{\\max[\\hat{SR}]_N-\\alpha}{\\beta}] \u0026amp;=\u0026amp; M_x\u0026#39;(t)|_{t=0} \\\\\r\u0026amp;=\u0026amp; (-1)\\Gamma\u0026#39;(1) \\\\\r\u0026amp;=\u0026amp; (-1)(-\\gamma) = \\gamma\r\\end{eqnarray}\r\\]\rHere, $… $ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. Thus, when \\(N\\) is large, the expected value of the maximum statistic of the standard normal distribution of i.i.d. is approximated as (\\(N\u0026gt;1\\))\n\\[\rE[\\max[\\hat{SR}]] \\approx \\alpha + \\gamma\\beta = (1-\\gamma)Z^{-1}[1-\\frac{1}{N}]+\\gamma Z^{-1}[1-\\frac{1}{N}e^{-1}] \\tag{2}\r\\]\rThis is Proposition 1 of Bailey et. al. (2015). We plot \\(E[\\max[\\hat{SR}]]\\) as a function of the number of strategies (number of trials and errors) \\(N\\), which is shown below.\nlibrary(ggplot2)\rExMaxSR = function(N){\rgamma_ct = -digamma(1)\rZ = qnorm(0.99)\rreturn((1-gamma_ct)*Z*(1-1/N) + gamma_ct*Z*(1-1/N*exp(1)^{-1}))\r}\rN = list(0:100)\rresult = purrr::map(N,ExMaxSR)\rggplot2::ggplot(data.frame(ExpMaxSR = unlist(result),N = unlist(N)),aes(x=N,y=ExpMaxSR)) +\rgeom_line(size=1) + ylim(0,3)\rYou can see that the expected value of \\(\\max[\\hat{SR}]\\) is rapidly increasing for the small \\(N\\). At \\(N=10\\), we expect to find at least one apparently quite good performing strategy, even though the true value of the Sharpe ratio of all strategies is zero. In finance, hold-out back-testing is often used, but this method does not take into account the number of trials, which is why it does not return reliable results when \\(N\\) is large. Don’t you think it’s very risky to do a lot of simulations in order to improve the backtest results? In the end, only the best performing of the \\(N\\) strategies will show up in the presentation material, so even if you consider 10 strategies, as in this example, any of them will have a Sharpe ratio distributed around 1.87. Of course, we don’t include the number of trials and errors in our materials, so it’s very misleading. When evaluating these materials, you might want to suspect false positives first.\nSo, as for what to do, Bailey et. al. (2015) calculate the Minimum Backtest Length. In short, they caution that as the number of trials (errors) \\(N\\) is increased, the number of years of backtesting \\(y\\) should also increase. Let’s show the relationship between \\(N\\) and the Minimum Backtest Length. As before, we will assume that \\(\\mu=0\\), but consider the case with \\(y\\neq 1\\). The expected value of the maximum statistic of the annualized Sharpe ratio is from equation (2)\n\\[\rE[\\max[\\hat{SR}(q)]_N] \\approx y^{-1/2}((1-\\gamma)Z^{-1}[1-\\frac{1}{N}]+\\gamma Z^{-1}[1-\\frac{1}{N}e^{-1}])\r\\]\rBy solving this for \\(y\\), you can get MinBTL.\n\\[\rMinBTL \\approx (\\frac{(1-\\gamma)Z^{-1}[1-\\frac{1}{N}]+\\gamma Z^{-1}[1-\\frac{1}{N}e^{-1}]}{\\bar{E[\\max[\\hat{SR}(q)]_N]}})^2\r\\]\rHere, \\(\\bar{E[\\max[\\hat{SR}(q)]_N]}\\) is the upper limit of \\(E[\\max[\\hat{SR}(q)]_N]\\), and the \\(N\\) strategy, where the true value of the Sharpe ratio is zero, suppresses the value that the maximum Sharpe ratio statistic can take. In doing so, the required backtesting years \\(y\\) are derived as MinBTL. Plotting the MinBTL as a function of \\(N\\), with \\(\\bar{E[\\max[\\hat{SR}(q)]_N]}=1\\) is shown below.\nMinBTL \u0026lt;- function(N,MaxSR){\rreturn((ExMaxSR(N)/MaxSR)^2)\r}\rN = list(1:100)\rresult = purrr::map2(N,1,MinBTL)\rggplot2::ggplot(data.frame(MinBTL = unlist(result),N = unlist(N)),aes(x=N,y=MinBTL)) +\rgeom_line(size=1) + ylim(0,6)\rsimSR \u0026lt;- function(T1){\rr = rnorm(T1)\rreturn(mean(r)/sd(r))\r}\rIf your backtesting period is less than 3 years, the number of trials (or errors) \\(N\\) should be limited to one. It is important to note that even if you are backtesting within the MinBTL, it is still possible to overfit. In other words, the MinBTL is a necessary condition, not a sufficient condition.\n\r4. At the end\rLópez de Prado (2018) lists the following as generic means of preventing overfitting\nDevelop models for entire asset classes or investment universes, rather than for specific securities. Investors diversify, hence they do not make mistake X only on security Y. If you find mistake X only on security Y, no matter how apparently profitable, it is likely a false discovery.\n\rApply bagging as a means to both prevent overfitting and reduce the variance of the forecasting error. If bagging deteriorates the performance of a strategy, it was likely overfit to a small number of observations or outliers.\n\rDo not backtest until all your research is complete.\n\rRecord every backtest conducted on a dataset so that the probability of backtest overfitting may be estimated on the final selected result (see Bailey, Borwein, López de Prado and Zhu(2017)), and the Sharpe ratio may be properly deflated by the number of trials carried out (Bailey and López de Prado(2014.b)).\n\rSimulate scenarios rather than history. A standard backtest is a historical simulation, which can be easily overfit. History is just the random path that was realized, and it could have been entirely different. Your strategy should be profitable under a wide range of scenarios, not just the anecdotal historical path. It is harder to overfit the outcome of thousands of “what if” scenarios.\n\rDo not research under the influence of a backtest. If the backtest fails to identify a profitable strategy,\rstart from scratch. Resist the temptation of reusing those results.\n\r\rI think 3 and 6 are relevant contexts for today’s post. There is an accumulation of other research in this area, so if you’re going to do backtesting on the job, it’s good to study techniques, but I recommend learning about the proper way to operate backtesting as a primer in the first place.\nIn this post, I’ve decided to tackle a slightly different topic from the usual one. I often see the results of backtests in my own work, and I often do hold-out backtests on this blog. I will continue to follow my research on this topic so that I can understand and evaluate the uncertainty of the results obtained.\n\r","date":1594166400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594166400,"objectID":"ffd693614e217f006fe4ab18e5859efb","permalink":"/en/post/post19/","publishdate":"2020-07-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/post/post19/","section":"post","summary":"I'm sure that if you are a quants and are planning a new strategy, you may want to backtest to see its performance.

This time I would like to write an article about predicting horse racing. In the last post, I created a prediction model for horse racing rankings using table data obtained from yahoo horse racing using LightGBM. I used structural data last time, but anyone can do this kind of analysis in these days. So this time, I developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which extracts features from a horse’s body image and predicts its ranking. This is the second time I’ve used Earth Engine to analyze satellite images, and the first time I’ve used deep learning in this blog. The code is written in Python.\n1. Crawling for data collection\rThe first step is to collect images of the horse’s body from the internet; the best thing to do would be to use pictures of the paddock on race day. However, as far as I’ve been able to find, there are no sites that post photos of the paddock in a cohesive format. It may be interesting to use it as a clipped image or to apply it as a video to the Encoder-Decoder model of CNN to RNN, because it may be that a horse racing fan may have a paddock video on Youtube. However, I don’t have the ability to do that much.\nWhere to get the data from\rSo in this case, the data is taken from Daley’s Web site. Here you can find pre-race photos of horses running in the last 1 year? You can find pre-race photos of horses running in G1 races in the past year? Horse bettors who can’t go to the actual racecourse can look at these pictures and analyze the condition of the horses.\nPlease note that this site does not include body photos of all the horses that are entered in the race. Also, since this is only a limited number of G1 races, it’s entirely possible that all the horses are finished to begin with, and it’s entirely possible that you won’t be able to tell the difference. However, I’ll make it a priority to try and do it quickly and use this data for this one.\n\rRunning crawling by selenium\rFor crawling, we’ll use selenium. I won’t go into web crawling as I’m mainly using CNN in this article. The code I used is as follows.\n[Note] If you use the following codes, please do so at your own risk.\nfrom selenium import webdriver\rfrom selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options\rfrom selenium.webdriver.support.select import Select\rfrom selenium.webdriver.common.by import By\rfrom selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys\rfrom selenium.webdriver.common.alert import Alert\rfrom selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait\rfrom selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC\rfrom selenium.common.exceptions import TimeoutException\rfrom selenium.webdriver.common.action_chains import ActionChains\rfrom time import sleep\rfrom urllib import request\rimport random\r# selenium option settings (spell)\roptions = Options()\roptions.add_argument(\u0026#39;--disable-gpu\u0026#39;);\roptions.add_argument(\u0026#39;--disable-extensions\u0026#39;);\roptions.add_argument(\u0026#39;--proxy-server=\u0026quot;direct://\u0026quot;\u0026#39;);\roptions.add_argument(\u0026#39;--proxy-bypass-list=*\u0026#39;);\roptions.add_argument(\u0026#39;--start-maximized\u0026#39;);\r# driver specification\rDRIVER_PATH = r\u0026#39;C:/Users/aashi/Desktop/chromedriver_win32/chromedriver.exe\u0026#39;\rdriver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=DRIVER_PATH, chrome_options=options)\r# Pass the url and go to the site\rurl = \u0026#39;https://www.daily.co.jp/horse/horsecheck/photo/\u0026#39;\rdriver.get(url)\rdriver.implicitly_wait(15) # Maximum time to wait for an object to load, and if this is exceeded, an error\rsleep(5) # 1 second sleep as the web page transition is performed\r# Image data is saved for each race.\rselector0 = \u0026quot;body \u0026gt; div \u0026gt; main \u0026gt; div \u0026gt; div.primaryContents \u0026gt; article \u0026gt; div \u0026gt; section \u0026gt; a\u0026quot;\relements = driver.find_elements_by_css_selector(selector0)\rfor i in range(0,len(elements)):\relements = driver.find_elements_by_css_selector(selector0)\relement = elements[i]\relement.click()\rsleep(5) # 5 seconds sleep as the web page transition is performed\rtarget = driver.find_element_by_link_text(\u0026#39;Ｇ１馬体診断写真集のTOP\u0026#39;)\ractions = ActionChains(driver)\ractions.move_to_element(target)\ractions.perform()\rsleep(5) # 5 seconds sleep as the web page transition is performed\rselector = \u0026quot;body \u0026gt; div.wrapper.horse.is-fixedHeader.is-fixedAnimation \u0026gt; main \u0026gt; div \u0026gt; div.primaryContents \u0026gt; article \u0026gt; article \u0026gt; div.photoDetail-wrapper \u0026gt; section \u0026gt; div \u0026gt; figure\u0026quot;\rfigures = driver.find_elements_by_css_selector(selector)\rdownload_dir = r\u0026#39;C:\\Users\\aashi\\umanalytics\\photo\\image\u0026#39;\rselector = \u0026quot;body \u0026gt; div \u0026gt; main \u0026gt; div \u0026gt; div.primaryContents \u0026gt; article \u0026gt; article \u0026gt; div.photoDetail-wrapper \u0026gt; section \u0026gt; h1\u0026quot;\rrace_name = driver.find_element_by_css_selector(selector).text\rfor figure in figures:\rimg_name = figure.find_element_by_tag_name(\u0026#39;figcaption\u0026#39;).text\rhorse_src = figure.find_element_by_tag_name(\u0026#39;img\u0026#39;).get_attribute(\u0026quot;src\u0026quot;) save_name = download_dir + \u0026#39;/\u0026#39; + race_name + \u0026#39;_\u0026#39; + img_name + \u0026#39;.jpg\u0026#39;\rrequest.urlretrieve(horse_src,save_name)\rdriver.back()\rThe saved images were cross-checked with the actual race results and manually divided into the top three groups and the rest of the groups.

Keras is one of the Neural Network libraries that runs on Tensorflow and Theano. Keras is one of the Neural Network libraries that runs on Tensorflow and Theano. Keras is characterized by its ability to build models with relatively short code and its many learning algorithms.\n\rWhat is CNN?\rCNN is a type of (Deep) Neural Network often used in image analysis, and as its name suggests, it is an additional convolution. Convolution is a process like the following.\nConvolutional Layer Processing\n\rThe input here is the image data. Image analysis recognizes and analyzes images as numerical values. The image on the computer is represented by the RGB value, which is a numerical value from 0 to 255 of three colors, red (Red), green (Green) and blue (Blue). There are three layers of vectors in the form of 255 red, 0 green, 0 blue, and so on, and in this case a perfect red is represented. In the case above, you can think of a, b, c, etc. as representing one of the RGB values of each pixel. Convolution calculates the features of an image by taking the inner product of these RGB values with a matrix called the kernel. The following video(Japanese) is a good example of what the convolution layer means.\n\rBy learning the kernel to successfully get the distinctive parts of that image, it is possible to identify the image. I think the convolutional layer is the most important part of the CNN.\nThe Big Picture of CNN\n\rAs shown in the above figure, CNN has not only convolutional layers but also input and output layers as well as usual Neural Network layers. If you want to know about the MaxPooling layer, see the following movie(Japanese).\n\rAlthough the gradient method is known as the most orthodox training method for deep learning, various extension algorithms such as Adam have been proposed. Basically, Adam or momentum is often used.\n\rCoding\rNow, let’s get to the coding.\nfrom keras.utils import np_utils\rfrom keras.models import Sequential\rfrom keras.layers.convolutional import MaxPooling2D\rfrom keras.layers import Activation, Conv2D, Flatten, Dense,Dropout\rfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\rfrom keras.optimizers import SGD, Adadelta, Adagrad, Adam, Adamax, RMSprop, Nadam\rfrom PIL import Image\rimport numpy as np\rimport glob\rimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\rimport time\rimport os\rThe first step is to convert the collected image data to numerical data to create the training data.\rThe directory structure is as follows, with the top image and other images being stored in separate directories.

What I’m considering now is a binary classification of “top” and “other”, but I defined “top” as the top 3, so the data is unbalanced (about 5 times as much other data as the top data). In this case, if we train on the data as it is, it is easier to predict the label with the larger sample size (in this case, “other”), and the model will have a bias. Therefore, it is necessary to adjust the training data so that the sample size is the same for each of the two classes.\nindex_zero = np.random.choice(np.array(np.where(y_train[:,1]==0))[0,],np.count_nonzero(y_train[:,1]==1),replace=False)\rindex_one = np.array(np.where(y_train[:,1]==1))[0]\ry_resampled = y_train[np.hstack((index_one,index_zero))]\rX_resampled = X_train[np.hstack((index_one,index_zero))]\rWe will use this y_resampled and X_resampled for the training data. Next, we will build the CNN.

The paper is available here.\nTherefore, I would like to formulate this part of the problem here, although a correction is needed. I will describe the current binary classification problem as the problem of predicting the objective variable \\(Y\\), which takes a binary value from the explanatory thousand \\(X\\). Let \\((X,Y)\\) be a dataset where the positive example is considerably less than the negative example and the sample size of the negative example is matched to the positive example as \\((X_s,Y_s)\\). We define a categorical variable \\(s\\) that takes 1 if the \\((X,Y)\\) sample set is also included in \\((X_s,Y_s)\\) and 0 if it is not.\rGiven an explanatory variable \\(x\\) to the model constructed using the dataset \\((X,Y)\\), the positive example and the conditional probability of predicting can be expressed as \\(P(y=1|x)\\). On the other hand, the conditional probability of predicting a positive example in a model constructed using \\((X_s,Y_s)\\) can be expressed as \\(P(y=1|x)\\) using Bayes’ theorem and the categorical variable \\(s\\).\n\\[\rP(y=1|x,s=1) = \\frac{P(s=1|y=1)P(y=1|x)}{P(s=1|y=1)P(y=1|x) + P(s=1|y=0)P(y=0|x)}\r\\]\rIt can be written as. Since \\((X_s,Y_s)\\) matches the sample size of the negative example to the positive example, \\(P(s=1,y=1)=1\\), the above formula is rewritten as\n\\[\rP(y=1|x,s=1) = \\frac{P(y=1|x)}{P(y=1|x) + P(s=1|y=0)P(y=0|x)}\r= \\frac{P(y=1|x)}{P(y=1|x) + P(s=1|y=0)(1-P(y=1|x))}\r\\]\rIt is self-evident from the definition of \\((X_s,Y_s)\\) that \\(P(s=1|y=0)\\neq0\\) (0 would result in unbalanced data with only positive examples). Thus, as long as \\(P(y=0,x) \\neq0\\), the probability that the undersampling model will be rejected as a positive example is positively biased against the probability that the original data set will produce. What we want to find is \\(P(y=1|x)\\) with no bias, so \\(P=P(y=1|x),P_s=P(y|x,s=1),\\beta=P(s=1,y=0)\\), then we can get\n\\[\rP = \\frac{\\beta P_s}{\\beta P_s-P_s+1}\r\\]\rand can use this relationship formula to correct for bias.\rLet’s define what we’ve just identified as a function.\ndef calibration(y_proba, beta):\rreturn y_proba / (y_proba + (1 - y_proba) / beta)\rsampling_rate = sum(y_train[:,1]) / sum(1-y_train[:,1])\ry_proba_calib = calibration(model.predict(X_test), sampling_rate)\ry_pred = np_utils.to_categorical(np.argmax(y_proba_calib,axis=1), dense_size)\rfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, ConfusionMatrixDisplay, accuracy_score\rscore = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)\rprint(\u0026#39;Test accuracy:\u0026#39;, score)\r## Test accuracy: 0.2711864406779661\rIt’s not good at all.

I’d love to do it when I’m good enough to do it (I don’t know when that will be). Until then, I need to improve my PC specs.

I attended a workshop on asset allocation at my place of work, so I’d like to run some simulations here, even though this field is completely outside my expertise. In this article, I would like to do an exercise on how to estimate the variance-covariance matrix (predictions) of a minimum variance portfolio as the base portfolio, referring to previous studies. The reference research is in the following paper (in the Journal of Operations Research).\nAsset Allocation with Correlation: A Composite Trade-Off\n1. Minimum Variance Portfolio\rI won’t go into a detailed explanation of the minimum variance portfolio here, but it is a portfolio that calculates the average return and variance of each asset (domestic stocks, foreign stocks, domestic bonds, foreign bonds, and alternatives), plots them on a quadratic plane of average return vertical and variance horizontal axes, calculates the range of possible investments, and then calculates the smallest variance in the set (see the chart below).\nminimum variance portfolio\n\rIn an earlier study, Carroll et. al. (2017), the following is stated\n\rthis paper focusses on minimum-variance portfolios requiring only estimates of asset covariance, hence bypassing the well-known problem of estimation error in forecasting expected asset returns.\n\rEven at present, it is difficult to estimate expected returns, and a minimum variance portfolio, which does not require it, is a useful and practical technique. The objective function of a minimum variance portfolio is, as the name implies, to minimize diversification. If we now denote the vector of collected returns for each asset by \\(r\\), the holding weight of each asset by \\(\\theta\\), and the portfolio return by \\(R_{p}\\), then the overall portfolio variance \\(var(R_{p})\\) can be written as follows.\n\\[\rvar(R_{p}) = var(r^{T}\\theta) = E( (r^{T}\\theta)(r^{T}\\theta)^{T}) = \\theta^{T}\\Sigma\\theta\r\\]\nwhere \\(Sigma\\) is the variance-covariance matrix of \\(r\\). Thus, the minimization problem is as follows\n\\[\r\\min_{\\theta}(\\theta^{T}\\Sigma\\theta) \\\\\rs.t 1^{T}\\theta = 1\r\\]\nHere we have added full investment as a constraint. Let’s use the Lagrangian to solve this problem. The Lagrange function \\(L\\) is as follows\n\\[\rL = \\theta^{T}\\Sigma\\theta + \\lambda(1^{T}\\theta - 1)\r\\]\nThe first condition is\n\\[\r\\displaystyle\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\theta} = 2\\Sigma\\theta + 1\\lambda = 0 \\\\\r\\displaystyle \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\lambda} = 1^{T} \\theta = 1\r\\]\nSolving the first equation for \\(\\theta\\), we find that\n\\[\r\\theta = \\Sigma^{-1}1\\lambda^{*}\r\\]\nwhere \\(\\lambda^{*}=-1/2\\lambda\\). Substitute this into the second formula and solve for \\(\\lambda^{*}\\)\n\\[\r1^{T}\\Sigma1\\lambda^{*} = 1 \\\\\r\\displaystyle \\lambda^{*} = \\frac{1}{1^{T}\\Sigma^{-1}1}\r\\]\nSince \\(\\theta = \\Sigma^{-1}1\\lambda^{*}\\), erasing \\(\\lambda^{*}\\) will cause it to be\n\\[\r\\displaystyle \\theta_{gmv} = \\frac{\\Sigma^{-1}1}{1^{T}\\Sigma^{-1}1}\r\\]\nand we can now find the optimal weight. For now, I’ll implement this in R.\ngmv \u0026lt;- function(r_dat,r_cov){\rlibrary(MASS)\ri \u0026lt;- matrix(1,NCOL(r_dat),1)\rr_weight \u0026lt;- (ginv(r_cov)%*%i)/as.numeric(t(i)%*%ginv(r_cov)%*%i)\rwr_dat \u0026lt;- r_dat*as.numeric(r_weight)\rportfolio \u0026lt;- apply(wr_dat,1,sum)\rpr_dat \u0026lt;- data.frame(wr_dat,portfolio)\rsd \u0026lt;- sd(portfolio)\rresult \u0026lt;- list(r_weight,pr_dat,sd)\rnames(result) \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;weight\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;return\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;portfolio risk\u0026quot;) return(result)\r}\rnlgmv \u0026lt;- function(r_dat,r_cov){\rqp.out \u0026lt;- solve.QP(Dmat=r_cov,dvec=rep(0,NCOL(r_dat)),Amat=cbind(rep(1,NCOL(r_dat)),diag(NCOL(r_dat))),\rbvec=c(1,rep(0,NCOL(r_dat))),meq=1)\rr_weight \u0026lt;- qp.out$solution\rwr_dat \u0026lt;- r_dat*r_weight\rportfolio \u0026lt;- apply(wr_dat,1,sum)\rpr_dat \u0026lt;- data.frame(wr_dat,portfolio)\rsd \u0026lt;- sd(portfolio)\rresult \u0026lt;- list(r_weight,pr_dat,sd)\rnames(result) \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;weight\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;return\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;portfolio risk\u0026quot;)\rreturn(result)\r}\rThe input is a return and variance-covariance matrix for each asset. The output is the weight, return and risk. nlgmv is a short-sale constrained version of the minimum variance portfolio. Since we cannot get an analytical solution, we are trying to get a numerical solution.\n\r2. How to predict the variance-covariance matrix\rWe have found the formula for the minimum variance portfolio. The next step is to analyze how to find the input, the variance-covariance matrix. I think the most primitive approach would be the historical approach of finding the covariance matrix for a sample of return data available before that point in time, and then finding the minimum variance portfolio by fixing the value of the covariance matrix (i.e., the weights are also fixed). However, since this is just using historical averages for future projections, I’m sure there will be all sorts of problems. As a non-specialist, I can think of a situation where the return on asset A declined significantly the day before, but the variance of this asset is expected to remain high tomorrow, and the effect of yesterday is diluted by using the average. And I feel that not changing the weights from the start would also move away from the optimal point over time. However, there seems to be some trial and error in this area as to how to estimate it then. Also, in Carroll et. al. (2017), it is stated that,\n\rThe estimation of covariance matrices for portfolios with a large number of assets still remains a fundamental challenge in portfolio optimization.\n\rThe estimates in this paper are based on the following models. All of them are unique in that the variance-covariance matrix is time-varying.\nA. Constant conditional correlation (CCC) model\rThe original paper is here.\nFirst, from the relationship between the variance-covariance matrix and the correlation matrix, we have \\(\\Sigma_{t} = D_{t}R_{t}D_{t}\\), where \\(R_{t}\\) is the variance-covariance matrix and \\(D_{t}\\) is \\(diag(\\sigma_{1,t},...,\\sigma_{N,t})\\), a matrix whose diagonal components are the standard deviation of each asset in \\(tt\\) period. From here, we estimate \\(D_{t}\\) and \\(R_{t}\\) separately. First, \\(D_{t}\\) is estimated using the following multivariate GARCH model (1,1).\n\\[\rr_{t} = \\mu + u_{t} \\\\\ru_{t} = \\sigma_{t}\\epsilon \\\\\r\\sigma_{t}^{2} = \\alpha_{0} + \\alpha_{1}u_{t-1}^{2} + \\alpha_{2}\\sigma_{t-1}^{2} \\\\\r\\epsilon_{t} = NID(0,1) \\\\\rE(u_{t}|u_{t-1}) = 0\r\\]\rwhere \\(\\mu\\) is the sample mean of the returns. \\(\\alpha_{i}\\) is the parameter to be estimated. Since we are estimating \\(D_{t}\\) with GARCH, we can say that we are modeling a relationship where the distribution of returns follows a thicker base distribution than the normal distribution and where the change in returns is not constant but depends on the variance of the previous day. We can say that we have estimated \\(D_{t}\\) in this way. The next step in the estimation of \\(R_{t}\\) is to take a historical approach to the estimation of \\(R_{t}\\), in which the returns are sampled. In other words, \\(R_{t}\\) is a constant. Thus, we are making the assumption that the magnitude of return variation varies with time, but the relative relationship of each asset is invariant.\n\rB. Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC) model\rThe original paper is here。\nこちらのモデルでは、\\(D_{t}\\)を求めるところまでは①と同じですが、[\\(R_{t}\\)の求め方が異なっており、ARMA(1,1)を用いて推計します。相関行列はやはり定数ではないということで、\\(tex:t\\)期までに利用可能なリターンを用いて推計をかけようということになっています。このモデルの相関行列\\(R_{t}\\)は、\nThis model is the same as (1) up to the point of finding \\(D_{t}\\), but the way of finding \\(R_{t}\\) is different, and we use ARMA(1,1) to estimate it. Since the correlation matrix is still not a constant, we are going to use the available returns up to the \\(t\\) period to make the estimate. The correlation matrix \\(R_{t}\\) in this model is\n\\[\rR_{t} = diag(Q_{t})^{-1/2}Q_{t}diag(Q_{t})^{-1/2}\r\\]\nwhere \\(Q_{t}\\) is a conditional variance-covariance matrix in the \\(t\\) period, formulated as follows,\n\\[\rQ_{t} = \\bar{Q}(1-a-b) + adiag(Q_{t-1})^{1/2}\\epsilon_{i,t-1}\\epsilon_{i,t-1}diag(Q_{t-1})^{1/2} + bQ_{t-1}\r\\]\nwhere \\(\\bar{Q}\\) is the variance-covariance matrix calculated in a historical way and \\(a,b\\) is the parameter. This method differs from the previous one in that it assumes that not only does the magnitude of return variation vary with time, but also the relative relationship of each asset changes over time. Since we have observed some events in which the returns of all assets fall and the correlation of each asset becomes positive during a financial crisis, this formulation may be attractive.\n\rC. Dynamic Equicorrelation (DECO) model\rThe original paper is here。\nI haven’t read this paper exactly yet, but from the definition of the correlation matrix \\(R_{t}\\) becomes\n\\[\rR_{t} = (1-\\rho_{t})I_{N} + \\rho_{t}1\r\\]\nHere, \\(\\rho_{t}\\) is a scalar and a coefficient for the degree of equicorrelation, and I understand that equicorrelation is an average pair-wise correlation. In other words, if there are no missing values, it’s no different than a normal correlation. However, it seems to be a good estimator in that respect, because as assets increase, such problems need to be addressed. We can calculate \\(\\rho_{t}\\) as follows.\n\\[\r\\displaystyle \\rho_{t} = \\frac{1}{N(N-1)}(\\iota^{T}R_{t}^{DCC}\\iota - N) = \\frac{2}{N(N-1)}\\sum_{i\u0026gt;j}\\frac{q_{ij,t}}{\\sqrt{q_{ii,t} q_{jj,t}}}\r\\]\nwhere \\(\\iota\\) is an \\(N×1\\) vector with all elements being 1. And \\(q_{ij,t}\\) is the \\(i,j\\) element of \\(Q_{t}\\).\nNow that we’ve modeled the variance-covariance matrix, we’ll implement it so far in R.\ncarroll \u0026lt;- function(r_dat,FLG){\rlibrary(rmgarch)\rif(FLG == \u0026quot;benchmark\u0026quot;){\rH \u0026lt;- cov(r_dat)\r}else{\r#1. define variables\rN \u0026lt;- NCOL(r_dat) # the number of assets\r#2. estimate covariance matrix\rbasic_garch = ugarchspec(mean.model = list(armaOrder = c(0, 0),include.mean=TRUE), variance.model = list(garchOrder = c(1,1), model = \u0026#39;sGARCH\u0026#39;), distribution.model = \u0026#39;norm\u0026#39;)\rmulti_garch = multispec(replicate(N, basic_garch))\rdcc_set = dccspec(uspec = multi_garch, dccOrder = c(1, 1), distribution = \u0026quot;mvnorm\u0026quot;,model = \u0026quot;DCC\u0026quot;)\rfit_dcc_garch = dccfit(dcc_set, data = r_dat, fit.control = list(eval.se = TRUE))\rforecast_dcc_garch \u0026lt;- dccforecast(fit_dcc_garch)\rif (FLG == \u0026quot;CCC\u0026quot;){\r#Constant conditional correlation (CCC) model\rD \u0026lt;- sigma(forecast_dcc_garch)\rR_ccc \u0026lt;- cor(r_dat)\rH \u0026lt;- diag(D[,,1])%*%R_ccc%*%diag(D[,,1])\rcolnames(H) \u0026lt;- colnames(r_dat)\rrownames(H) \u0026lt;- colnames(r_dat)\r}\relse{\r#Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC) model\rH \u0026lt;- as.matrix(rcov(forecast_dcc_garch)[[1]][,,1])\rif (FLG == \u0026quot;DECO\u0026quot;){\r#Dynamic Equicorrelation (DECO) model\rone \u0026lt;- matrix(1,N,N)\riota \u0026lt;- rep(1,N)\rQ_dcc \u0026lt;- rcor(forecast_dcc_garch,type=\u0026quot;Q\u0026quot;)[[1]][,,1]\rrho \u0026lt;- as.vector((N*(N-1))^(-1)*(t(iota)%*%Q_dcc%*%iota-N))\rD \u0026lt;- sigma(forecast_dcc_garch)\rR_deco \u0026lt;- (1-rho)*diag(1,N,N) + rho*one\rH \u0026lt;- diag(D[,,1])%*%R_deco%*%diag(D[,,1])\rcolnames(H) \u0026lt;- colnames(r_dat)\rrownames(H) \u0026lt;- colnames(r_dat)\r}\r}\r}\rreturn(H)\r}\rI shouldn’t normally use the package, but since it’s an exercise today I’m only going to pursue the results of the estimates, and I’ll be writing a post about GARCH in the next week or so.\rNow we’re ready to go.

What is GPR?\r2. Implementation of the `GPR’\r\r\r　Hi. Yesterday, I wrote an article about Bayesian Vector Autoregression.\rIn the article, the topic of hyperparameter tuning came up, and looking for some efficient way to tune it, I found Bayesian Optimization. Since I am planning to use machine learning methods in daily GDP, I thought that Bayesian Optimization could be quite useful, and I spent all night yesterday to understand it.\nI will implement it here, but Bayesian Optimization uses Gaussian Pocess Regression (GPR), and my motivation for writing this entry was to implement it first. I will write about the implementation of Bayesian Optimization after this entry.\n1. What is GPR?\r　The GRP is, simply put, a type of nonlinear regression method using Bayesian estimation. Although the model itself is linear, it is characterized by its ability to estimate infinite nonlinear transformations of input variables using a kernel trick as explanatory variables (depending on what you choose for the kernel).\rThe GPR assumes that \\(N\\) input and teacher data are available for training, and the \\(N+1\\) of input data are also available. From this situation, we can predict the \\(N+1\\)th teacher data.\nThe data contains noise and follows the following probability model.\r\\[\rt_{i} = y_{i} + \\epsilon_{i}\r\\]\rwhere \\(t_{i}\\) is the \\(i\\)th observable teacher data (scalar), \\(y_{i}\\) is the unobservable output data (scalar), and \\(\\beta_{i}\\) follows a normal distribution \\(N(0, \\beta^{-1})\\) with measurement error. \\(y_{i}\\) follows the following probability model.\n\\[\r\\displaystyle y_{i} = \\textbf{w}^{T}\\phi(x_{i})\r\\]\nwhere \\(x_{i}\\) is the ith input data vector, \\(\\phi(・)\\) is the non-linear function and \\(\\bf{w}^{T}\\) is the weight coefficient (regression coefficient) vector for each input data. As a nonlinear function, I assume \\(\\psi(x_{i}) = (x_{1,i}, x_{1,i}^{2},... ,x_{1,i}x_{2,i},...)\\). (\\(x_{1,i}\\) is the first variable in the \\(i\\)th input data \\(x_{i}\\)). The conditional probability of obtaining \\(t_{i}\\) from the probabilistic model of the teacher data, with the \\(i\\)th output data \\(y_{i}\\) obtained, is\n\\[\rp(t_{i}|y_{i}) = N(t_{i}|y_{i},\\beta^{-1})\r\\]\n\\(\\displaystyle \\textbf{t} = (t_{1},... ,t_{n})^{T}\\) and \\(\\displaystyle \\textbf{y} = (y_{1},... ,y_{n})^{T}\\), then by extending the above equation, we have\n\\[\r\\displaystyle p(\\textbf{t}|\\textbf{y}) = N(\\textbf{t}|\\textbf{y},\\beta^{-1}\\textbf{I}_{N})\r\\]\nWe assume that the expected value of \\(\\textbf{w}\\) as a prior distribution is 0, and all variances are \\(\\alpha\\). We also assume that \\(\\displaystyle \\textbf{y}\\) follows a Gaussian process. A Gaussian process is one where the simultaneous distribution of \\(\\displaystyle \\textbf{y}\\) follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution. In code, it looks like this\n# Define Kernel function\rKernel_Mat \u0026lt;- function(X,sigma,beta){\rN \u0026lt;- NROW(X)\rK \u0026lt;- matrix(0,N,N)\rfor (i in 1:N) {\rfor (k in 1:N) {\rif(i==k) kdelta = 1 else kdelta = 0\rK[i,k] \u0026lt;- K[k,i] \u0026lt;- exp(-t(X[i,]-X[k,])%*%(X[i,]-X[k,])/(2*sigma^2)) + beta^{-1}*kdelta\r}\r}\rreturn(K)\r}\rN \u0026lt;- 10 # max value of X\rM \u0026lt;- 1000 # sample size\rX \u0026lt;- matrix(seq(1,N,length=M),M,1) # create X\rtestK \u0026lt;- Kernel_Mat(X,0.5,1e+18) # calc kernel matrix\rlibrary(MASS)\rP \u0026lt;- 6 # num of sample path\rY \u0026lt;- matrix(0,M,P) # define Y\rfor(i in 1:P){\rY[,i] \u0026lt;- mvrnorm(n=1,rep(0,M),testK) # sample Y\r}\r# Plot\rmatplot(x=X,y=Y,type = \u0026quot;l\u0026quot;,lwd = 2)\r　The covariance matrix \\(K\\) between the elements of \\(\\displaystyle \\textbf{y}\\), \\(\\displaystyle y_{i} = \\textbf{w}^{T}\\phi(x_{i})\\) is calculated using the kernel method from the input \\(x\\). Then, from this \\(K\\) and average 0, we generate six series of multivariate normal random numbers and plot them.As these series are computed from a covariance matrix, we model that the more positive the covariance of each element, the more likely they are to be the same. Also, as you can see in the graphs, the graphs are very smooth and very flexible in their representation. The code samples and plots 1000 input points, limiting the input to 0 to 10 due to computational cost, but in principle, \\(x\\) is defined in the real number space, so \\(p(\\textbf{y})\\) follows an infinite dimensional multivariate normal distribution.\nAs described above, since \\(\\displaystyle \\textbf{y}\\) is assumed to follow a Gaussian process, \\(p(\\textbf{y})\\) follows a multivariate normal distribution \\(N(\\textbf{y}|0,K)\\) with simultaneous probability \\(p(\\textbf{y})\\) averaging 0 and the variance covariance matrix \\(K\\). Each element \\(K_{i,j}\\) of \\(K\\) is\n\\[\r\\begin{eqnarray}\rK_{i,j} \u0026amp;=\u0026amp; cov[y_{i},y_{j}] = cov[\\textbf{w}\\phi(x_{i}),\\textbf{w}\\phi(x_{j})] \\\\\r\u0026amp;=\u0026amp;\\phi(x_{i})\\phi(x_{j})cov[\\textbf{w},\\textbf{w}]=\\phi(x_{i})\\phi(x_{j})\\alpha\r\\end{eqnarray}\r\\]\nHere, the \\(\\phi(x_{i})\\phi(x_{j})\\alpha\\) is more expensive as the dimensionality of the \\(\\phi(x_{i})\\) is increased (i.e., the more non-linear transformation is applied, the less the calculation is completed). However, when the kernel function \\(k(x,x\u0026#39;)\\) is used, the computational complexity is higher in the dimensions of the sample size of the input data \\(x_{i},x_{j}\\), so the computation becomes easier. There are several types of kernel functions, but the following Gaussian kernels are commonly used.\n\\[\rk(x,x\u0026#39;) = a \\exp(-b(x-x\u0026#39;)^{2})\r\\]\nNow that we have defined the concurrent probability of \\(\\displaystyle \\textbf{y}\\), we can find the joint probability of \\(\\displaystyle \\textbf{t}\\).\n\\[\r\\begin{eqnarray}\r\\displaystyle p(\\textbf{t}) \u0026amp;=\u0026amp; \\int p(\\textbf{t}|\\textbf{y})p(\\textbf{y}) d\\textbf{y} \\\\\r\\displaystyle \u0026amp;=\u0026amp; \\int N(\\textbf{t}|\\textbf{y},\\beta^{-1}\\textbf{I}_{N})N(\\textbf{y}|0,K)d\\textbf{y} \\\\\r\u0026amp;=\u0026amp; N(\\textbf{y}|0,\\textbf{C}_{N})\r\\end{eqnarray}\r\\]\nwhere \\(\\textbf{C}_{N} = K + \\beta^{-1}\\beta^{I}_{N}\\). Note that the last expression expansion uses the regenerative nature of the normal distribution (the proof can be easily derived from the moment generating function of the normal distribution). The point is just to say that the covariance is the sum of the covariances of the two distributions, since they are independent. Personally, I imagine that \\(p(\\textbf{y})\\) is the prior distribution of the Gaussian process I just described, \\(p(\\textbf{t}|\\textbf{y})\\) is the likelihood function, and \\(p(\\textbf{t})\\) is the posterior distribution. The only constraint on the prior distribution \\(p(\\textbf{y})\\) is that it is smooth with a loosely constrained distribution.\rThe joint probability of \\(N\\) observable teacher data \\(\\textbf{t}\\) and \\(t_{N+1}\\) is\n\\[\rp(\\textbf{t},t_{N+1}) = N(\\textbf{t},t_{N+1}|0,\\textbf{C}_{N+1})\r\\]\nwhere \\(\\textbf{C}_{N+1}\\) is\n\\[\r\\textbf{C}_{N+1} = \\left(\r\\begin{array}{cccc}\r\\textbf{C}_{N} \u0026amp; \\textbf{k} \\\\\r\\textbf{k}^{T} \u0026amp; c \\\\\r\\end{array}\r\\right)\r\\]\nwhere \\(\\textbf{k} = (k(x_{1},x_{N+1}),...,k(x_{N},x_{N+1}))\\) and \\(c = k(x_{N+1},x_{N+1})\\). The conditional distribution \\(p(t_{N+1}|\\textbf{t})\\) can be obtained from the joint distribution of \\(\\textbf{t}\\) and \\(t_{N+1}\\).\n\\[\rp(t_{N+1}|\\textbf{t}) = N(t_{N+1}|\\textbf{k}^{T}\\textbf{C}_{N+1}^{-1}\\textbf{t},c-\\textbf{k}^{T}\\textbf{C}_{N+1}^{-1}\\textbf{k})\r\\]\nIn calculating the conditional distribution, we use Properties of the conditional multivariate normal distribution. As you can see from the above equation, the conditional distribution \\(p(t_{N+1}|\\textbf{t})\\) can be calculated if \\(N+1\\) input data, \\(N\\) teacher data, and parameters \\(a,b\\) of the kernel function are known, so if any point is given as input data, it is possible to approximate the Generating Process. The nice thing about the GPR is that it gives predictions without the direct estimation of the above defined probabilistic model \\(\\displaystyle y_{i} = \\textbf{w}^{T}\\phi(x_{i})\\). The stochastic model has \\(\\phi(x_{i})\\), which converts the input data to a high-dimensional vector through a nonlinear transformation. Therefore, the higher the dimensionality, the larger the computational complexity of the \\(\\phi(x_{i})\\phi(x_{j})\\alpha\\) will be, but the GPR uses a kernel trick, so the computational complexity of the sample size dimension of the input data vector will be sufficient.\n\r2. Implementation of the `GPR’\r　For now, let’s implement this in R, which I’ve implemented in PRML test data, so I tweaked it.\rlibrary(ggplot2)\rlibrary(grid)\r# 1.Gaussian Process Regression\r# PRML\u0026#39;s synthetic data set\rcurve_fitting \u0026lt;- data.frame(\rx=c(0.000000,0.111111,0.222222,0.333333,0.444444,0.555556,0.666667,0.777778,0.888889,1.000000),\rt=c(0.349486,0.830839,1.007332,0.971507,0.133066,0.166823,-0.848307,-0.445686,-0.563567,0.261502))\rf \u0026lt;- function(beta, sigma, xmin, xmax, input, train) {\rkernel \u0026lt;- function(x1, x2) exp(-(x1-x2)^2/(2*sigma^2)); # define Kernel function\rK \u0026lt;- outer(input, input, kernel); # calc gram matrix\rC_N \u0026lt;- K + diag(length(input))/beta\rm \u0026lt;- function(x) (outer(x, input, kernel) %*% solve(C_N) %*% train) # coditiona mean m_sig \u0026lt;- function(x)(kernel(x,x) - diag(outer(x, input, kernel) %*% solve(C_N) %*% t(outer(x, input, kernel)))) #conditional variance\rx \u0026lt;- seq(xmin,xmax,length=100)\routput \u0026lt;- ggplot(data.frame(x1=x,m=m(x),sig1=m(x)+1.96*sqrt(m_sig(x)),sig2=m(x)-1.96*sqrt(m_sig(x)),\rtx=input,ty=train),\raes(x=x1,y=m)) + geom_line() +\rgeom_ribbon(aes(ymin=sig1,ymax=sig2),alpha=0.2) +\rgeom_point(aes(x=tx,y=ty))\rreturn(output)\r}\rgrid.newpage() # make a palet\rpushViewport(viewport(layout=grid.layout(2, 2))) # divide the palet into 2 by 2\rprint(f(100,0.1,0,1,curve_fitting$x,curve_fitting$t), vp=viewport(layout.pos.row=1, layout.pos.col=1))\rprint(f(4,0.10,0,1,curve_fitting$x,curve_fitting$t), vp=viewport(layout.pos.row=1, layout.pos.col=2))\rprint(f(25,0.30,0,1,curve_fitting$x,curve_fitting$t), vp=viewport(layout.pos.row=2, layout.pos.col=1))\rprint(f(25,0.030,0,1,curve_fitting$x,curve_fitting$t), vp=viewport(layout.pos.row=2, layout.pos.col=2)) \rThe \\(beta^{-1}\\) represents the measurement error. The higher the value of \\(\\beta\\) (i.e., the smaller the measurement error), the easier it is to overfit, since the error of the predictions is less than that of the data already available. This is the case in the top left corner of the figure above. The top left corner is \\(\\beta=400\\), which means that it overfits the current data available. Conversely, a small value of \\(\\beta\\) will produce predictions that ignore the errors with the teacher data, but may improve the generalization performance. The top right figure shows this. For \\(beta=4\\), the average barely passes through the data points we have, and \\(b\\) is currently available. \\(b\\) represents the magnitude of the effect of the data we have at the moment on the surroundings. If \\(b\\) is small, the adjacent points will interact strongly with each other, which may reduce the accuracy but increase the generalization performance. Conversely, if \\(b\\) is large, the result will be unnatural, fitting only individual points. This is illustrated in the figure below right (\\(b=\\frac{1}{0.03}, \\beta=25\\)). As you can see, the graph is overfitting because of the large \\(\\beta\\) and because \\(b\\) is also large, so it fits only individual points, resulting in an absurdly large graph. The bottom left graph is the best. It has \\(b=\\frac{1}{0.3}\\), and \\(b=2\\). Let’s try extending the x interval of this graph to [0,2]. Then we get the following graph.\ngrid.newpage() # make a palet\rpushViewport(viewport(layout=grid.layout(2, 2))) # divide the palet into 2 by 2\rprint(f(100,0.1,0,2,curve_fitting$x,curve_fitting$t), vp=viewport(layout.pos.row=1, layout.pos.col=1)) print(f(4,0.10,0,2,curve_fitting$x,curve_fitting$t), vp=viewport(layout.pos.row=1, layout.pos.col=2)) print(f(25,0.30,0,2,curve_fitting$x,curve_fitting$t), vp=viewport(layout.pos.row=2, layout.pos.col=1))\rprint(f(25,0.030,0,2,curve_fitting$x,curve_fitting$t), vp=viewport(layout.pos.row=2, layout.pos.col=2)) \rAs you can see, all the graphs except the bottom left one have a band of 95% confidence intervals that immediately widen and are completely useless where there are no data points. On the other hand, the lower left graph has a decent band up to 1.3 to 1.4, and the average value seems to pass through a point that is consistent with our intuitive understanding of the function. You can also see that if you are too far away from the observable data points, you will get a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a variance of 1 no matter what you give to the parameters.\rNow that we have shown that the accuracy of the prediction of the out-sample varies depending on the value of the parameters, the question here is how to estimate these hyperparameters. This is done by using the gradient method to find the hyperparameters that maximize the log-likelihood function \\(\\ln p(\\bf{t}|a,b)\\) ((\\(\\beta\\) seems to be of a slightly different type, and the developmental discussion appears to take other tuning methods. We haven’t gotten to that level yet, so we’ll calibrate it here). Since \\(p(\\textbf{t}) = N(\\textbf{y}|0, \\textbf{C}_{N})\\), the log-likelihood function is\n\\[\r\\displaystyle \\ln p(\\textbf{t}|a,b,\\beta) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\ln|\\textbf{C}_{N}| - \\frac{N}{2}\\ln(2\\pi) - \\frac{1}{2}\\textbf{t}^{T}\\textbf{C}_{N}^{-1}\\textbf{k}\r\\]\nAfter that, we can differentiate this with the parameters and solve the obtained simultaneous equations to get the maximum likelihood estimator. Now let’s get the derivatives.\n\\[\r\\displaystyle \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_{i}} \\ln p(\\textbf{t}|\\theta) = -\\frac{1}{2}Tr(\\textbf{C}_{N}^{-1}\\frac{\\partial \\textbf{C}_{N}}{\\partial \\theta_{i}}) + \\frac{1}{2}\\textbf{t}^{T}\\textbf{C}_{N}^{-1}\r\\frac{\\partial\\textbf{C}_{N}}{\\partial\\theta_{i}}\\textbf{C}_{N}^{-1}\\textbf{t}\r\\]\nwhere \\(theta\\) is the parameter set and \\(theta_{i}\\) represents the \\(i\\)th parameter. If you don’t understand this derivative here in the supplement to (C.21) and (C.22) equations. Since we are using the Gaussian kernel in this case, we get\n\\[\r\\displaystyle \\frac{\\partial k(x,x\u0026#39;)}{\\partial a} = \\exp(-b(x-x\u0026#39;)^{2}) \\\\\r\\displaystyle \\frac{\\partial k(x,x\u0026#39;)}{\\partial b} = -a(x-x\u0026#39;)^{2}\\exp(-b(x-x\u0026#39;)^{2})\r\\]\nfrom the above formula. However, this time we will use the gradient method to find the best parameters.

According  to  the  Reference Dates of Business Cycle, the Cabinet Office of Japan, there are four recession periods between 1987 and 2010,  and  three  of  them  are  considered  to  be  financially-related.  This  implies  that  the  stagnation  wastriggered by financial factors. Nonetheless, many studies using Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium models claim that a decline in Total Factor Productivity is the main driver of the stagnation. To resolve this contradiction,  this study estimates the Japanese economy by a New-Keynesian  DSGE  model augmented with  financial  friction  used  in  Christiano,  Motto  and  Rostagno  (2014),  where “risk  shock”  is newly incorporated into the model that refers to uncertainty in the financial market. According to our estimationresults, the estimated risk shock can explain the overall fluctuations of GDP and investment, and thus it isconsidered to be the main driver of the stagnation. We also find that it is highly correlated with the Business condition  Diffusion  Index,  the  Financial  Position  Diffusion  Index  and  the  Lending  Attitude  Index  of  Financial Institutions in Tankan released by the Bank of Japan. Therefore, we conclude that the estimated risk  shock  can  be  interpreted  as  the  firms’   distrust  toward  their  business  conditions,  and  it  delayed  theirinvestment decisions, then causing the prolonged economic contraction.","tags":"","title":"Does Financial Risk Explain Japan’s Great Stagnation?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ayato Ashihara"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to get Bibtex and Cite ME !!
