I'm 28 years old, from Nara, Japan and currently in my forth year since completing graduate studies. I majored in macroeconomics (mainly Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibruim models), and also experimented with time series analysis and text mining. In 2018, I graduated and started working for an asset management company in Tokyo, mainly in strategic planning. In March 2022, I changed jobs and started my career path as a data consultant for an electronic components manufacturer in Kyoto, Japan.
