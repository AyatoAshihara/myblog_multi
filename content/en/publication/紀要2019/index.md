abstract: Japan  has  experienced  a  long-lasting  stagnation  since  the  early  1990s.  According  to  the  Reference Dates of Business Cycle, the Cabinet Office of Japan, there are four recession periods between 1987 and 2010,  and  three  of  them  are  considered  to  be  financially-related.  This  implies  that  the  stagnation  wastriggered by financial factors. Nonetheless, many studies using Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium models claim that a decline in Total Factor Productivity is the main driver of the stagnation. To resolve this contradiction,  this study estimates the Japanese economy by a New-Keynesian  DSGE  model augmented with  financial  friction  used  in  Christiano,  Motto  and  Rostagno  (2014),  where “risk  shock”  is newly incorporated into the model that refers to uncertainty in the financial market. According to our estimationresults, the estimated risk shock can explain the overall fluctuations of GDP and investment, and thus it isconsidered to be the main driver of the stagnation. We also find that it is highly correlated with the Business condition  Diffusion  Index,  the  Financial  Position  Diffusion  Index  and  the  Lending  Attitude  Index  of  Financial Institutions in Tankan released by the Bank of Japan. Therefore, we conclude that the estimated risk  shock  can  be  interpreted  as  the  firms’   distrust  toward  their  business  conditions,  and  it  delayed  theirinvestment decisions, then causing the prolonged economic contraction.
