summary: Hi. I'm doing an analysis using currency tick data, and the sample size is 12 million data per year. It's in memory, but it's very inefficient because it takes a lot of time to process each one of them when we try to do complicated processing. This time, I would like to introduce the way to compile functions written in C++ as functions on R using Rcpp package to increase the processing speed.

<h2>0. What I want to do</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, what I will show you this time is the pre-processing (and analysis) of currency tick data. I won’t go into details since my main focus is to improve efficiency of analysis using Rcpp, but I will give you a rough idea of what I want to do.</p>
<p>What we want to do is to detect <strong>jumps</strong> in the 5-minute returns of the JPY/USD rate. A jump here is a sudden rise (or fall) in the exchange rate compared to the previous point. During the day, exchange rates move in small increments, but when there is an event, they rise (or fall) significantly. It is very interesting to see what kind of event causes a jump. In order to verify this, we first need to detect jumps. The following paper will be used as a reference.</p>
<p><a href="https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article-abstract/21/6/2535/1574138?redirectedFrom=fulltext">Suzanne S. Lee &amp; Per A. Mykland, 2008. “Jumps in Financial Markets: A New Nonparametric Test and Jump Dynamics,” Review of Financial Studies, Society for Financial Studies, vol. 21(6), pages 2535-2563, November.</a></p>
<p>It is a highly regarded paper with a Citation of 204. I will explain the estimation method in brief. First, let the continuous compound return be <span class="math inline">\(d\log S(t)\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(t&gt;0\)</span>. where <span class="math inline">\(S(t)\)</span> is the price of the asset at <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. If there are no jumps in the market, <span class="math inline">\(S(t)\)</span> is assumed to follow the following stochastic process</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
d\log S(t) = \mu(t)dt + \sigma(t)dW(t) \tag{1}
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(W(t)\)</span> is the standard Brownian motion, <span class="math inline">\(\mu(t)\)</span> is the drift term, and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma(t)\)</span> is the spot volatility. Also, when there is a Jump, <span class="math inline">\(S(t)\)</span> is assumed to follow the following stochastic process</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
d\log S(t) = \mu(t)dt + \sigma(t)dW(t) + Y(t)dJ(t) \tag{2}
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(J(t)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(W(t)\)</span> are counting processes independent of each other. <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <span class="math inline">\(Y(t)\)</span> represents the size of the jump and is a predictable process.</p>
<p>Next, consider the logarithmic return of <span class="math inline">\(S(t)\)</span>. That is, <span class="math inline">\(\log S(t_i)/S(t_{i-1})\)</span>, which follows a normal distribution <span class="math inline">\(N(0, \sigma(t_i))\)</span>. <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Now, we define the statistic <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L(i)}\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(t_i\)</span> when there is a jump from <span class="math inline">\(t_{i-1}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(t_{i}\)</span> as follows.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{L(i)} \equiv \frac{|\log S(t_i)/S(t_{i-1})|}{\hat{\sigma}_{t_i}} \tag{3}
\]</span></p>
<p>This is a simple standardization of the absolute value of the log return, but uses the “Realized Bipower Variation” defined below as an estimator of the standard deviation.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\hat{\sigma}_{t_i} = \frac{1}{K-2}\sum_{j=i-K+2}^{i-2}|\log S(t_j)/\log S(t_{j-1})||\log S(t_{j-1})/\log S(t_{j-2})| \tag{4}
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is the number of sample sizes contained in the Window. If we use a return in 5-minute increments and the jump occurs at 10:00 on 9/10/2020, and <span class="math inline">\(K=270\)</span>, then we will calculate using samples from the previous day, 9/9/2020 11:30 to 9/11/2020 09:55. What we’re doing is adding up the absolute value of the return multiplied by the absolute value of the return, which seems to make it difficult for the estimate of the next instant after the jump occurs (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(t_{i+1}\)</span> and so on) to be affected by the jump. Incidentally, <span class="math inline">\(K=270\)</span> is introduced in another paper as a recommended value for returns in 5-minute increments.</p>
<p>Let’s move on to how the Jump statistic calculated in this way can be used in a statistical test to detect a Jump. This is done by considering the maximum value of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L(i)}\)</span>, and when a value deviates greatly from its distribution (such as the 95th percentile), the return is considered to be a Jump.</p>
<p>If we assume that there is no Jump in period <span class="math inline">\([t_{i-1},t_i]\)</span>, then let the length of this period <span class="math inline">\(\Delta=t_i-t_{i-1}\)</span>
close to 0, that is, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\rightarrow 0\)</span>, the (absolute) maximum of the standard normal variable converges to the Gumbel distribution. Therefore, Jump can be detected if the null hypothesis is rejected when the following conditions are met.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{L(i)} &gt; G^{-1}(1-\alpha)S_{n} + C_{n} \tag{5}
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(G^{-1}(1-\alpha)\)</span> is the <span class="math inline">\((1-\alpha)\)</span> quantile function of the standard Gumbell distribution. If <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=10%\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(G^{-1}(1-\alpha)=2.25\)</span>. Note that (We won’t derive it, but we can prove it using equations 1 and 2)</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
S_{n} = \frac{1}{c(2\log n)^{0.5}} \\
C_{n} = \frac{(2\log n)^{0.5}}{c}-\frac{\log \pi+\log(\log n)}{2c(2\log n)^{0.5}}
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(c=(2/\pi)^{0.5}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the total sample size used for estimation.
Finally, <span class="math inline">\(Jump_{t_i}\)</span> is calculated by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
Jump_{t_i} = \log\frac{S(t_i)}{S(t_{i-1})}×I(\mathcal{L(i)} - G^{-1}(1-\alpha)S_{n} + C_{n})\tag{6}
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(I(⋅)\)</span> is an Indicator function that returns 1 if the content is greater than 0 and 0 otherwise.</p>

<h2>1. Loading data</h2>
<p>So now that we know how to estimate, let’s load the Tick data first. The data is csv from <code>QuantDataManager</code> and saved in a working directory.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(magrittr)

# Read Tick data
strPath &lt;- r&quot;(C:\Users\hogehoge\JPYUSD_Tick_2011.csv)&quot;
JPYUSD &lt;- readr::read_csv(strPath)</code></pre>
<p>On an unrelated note, I recently upgraded R to 4.0.2, and I’m quite happy to say that with 4.0 and above, you can escape the strings made by <code>Python</code>, which relieves some of the stress I’ve been experiencing.</p>
<p>The data looks like the following: in addition to the date, the Bid value, Ask value and the volume of transactions are stored. Here, we use the 2011 tick. The reason for this is to cover the dollar/yen at the time of the Great East Japan Earthquake.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>summary(JPYUSD)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##     DateTime                        Bid             Ask            Volume     
##  Min.   :2011-01-03 07:00:00   Min.   :75.57   Min.   :75.58   Min.   : 1.00  
##  1st Qu.:2011-03-30 15:09:23   1st Qu.:77.43   1st Qu.:77.44   1st Qu.: 2.00  
##  Median :2011-06-15 14:00:09   Median :80.40   Median :80.42   Median : 2.00  
##  Mean   :2011-06-22 05:43:11   Mean   :79.91   Mean   :79.92   Mean   : 2.55  
##  3rd Qu.:2011-09-09 13:54:51   3rd Qu.:81.93   3rd Qu.:81.94   3rd Qu.: 3.00  
##  Max.   :2011-12-30 06:59:59   Max.   :85.52   Max.   :85.54   Max.   :90.00</code></pre>
<p>By the way, <code>DateTime</code> includes the period from 07:00:00 on 2011/1/3 to 06:59:59 on 2011-12-30 (16:59:59 on 2011-12-30) in Japan by UTC. The sample size is approximately 12 million entries.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>NROW(JPYUSD)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 11946621</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="preprocessing" class="section level2">
<h2>2. Preprocessing</h2>
<p>Then calculate the median value from Bid and Ask and take the logarithm to calculate the return later.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Calculate the median value of Ask and Bid and make it logarithmic (for calculating the logarithmic return).
JPYUSD &lt;- JPYUSD %&gt;% dplyr::mutate(Mid = (Ask+Bid)/2) %&gt;% 
                     dplyr::mutate(logMid = log(Mid))</code></pre>
<p>I format the currently irregularly arranged trading data into 5-minute increments of returns. The way to do it is:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Create a <code>POSIXct</code> vector with 1 year chopped every 5 minutes.</li>
<li>create a function that calculates the logarithmic return from the first and last sample in the window of 5min in turn, if you pass 1. as an argument.</li>
<li>execute. This is the plan. First, create the vector of 1.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code># Create POSIX vector to calculate returns in 5min increments (288 x days)
start &lt;- as.POSIXct(&quot;2011-01-02 22:00:00&quot;,tz=&quot;UTC&quot;)
end &lt;- as.POSIXct(&quot;2011-12-31 21:55:00&quot;,tz=&quot;UTC&quot;)
from &lt;- seq(from=start,to=end,by=5*60)</code></pre>
<p>Then, let’s move on to 2. If you have 12 million data, even if you use <code>purrr::map</code> or <code>apply</code> with <code>R</code>, it takes a long time to call a function and it’s quite inefficient. I tried to use <code>sapply</code>, but it didn’t complete the process and it was forced to terminate. <code>RCCp</code> is useful in such a case. Although <code>R</code> has many very useful functions for graphs and statistics, it is not very good at large repetition, including calls to user-defined functions (because it is a scripting language, rather than a compiling language, I mean). So, I write the part of repetitive process in <code>C++</code> and compile it as <code>R</code> function using <code>Rcpp</code> and execute it. It is very efficient to compile and visualize the results and write them in <code>R</code>. Also, <code>Rccp</code> helps you to write <code>C++</code> in a similar way to <code>R</code> with less sense of discomfort. I think the following will give you a good idea of the details. It’s pretty well organized and is God, to say the least.</p>
<p><a href="https://teuder.github.io/rcpp4everyone_en/">Rcpp for everyone</a></p>
<p>Now, let’s write the code for the second step. In coding, I used articles on the net for reference. C++ has a longer history and more users than <code>R</code>, so you can find information you want to know.</p>

<h2>4. Visualization using ggplot2</h2>
<p>Now that the numbers have been calculated, let’s visualize them by plotting the intraday logarithmic return of JPY/USD in 5-minute increments for 2011/03/11 and the jump. By the way, the horizontal axis has been adjusted to Japan time.</p>

<p>I’ve spent quite a bit of time writing this, and it’s 23:37 right now, so I’ll refrain from discussing it in depth, but since the earthquake occurred at 14:46:18, you can see that the market reacted to the weakening of the yen immediately after the disaster. After that, for some reason, the yen moved higher and peaked at 19:00. It is said that the yen is a safe asset, but this is the only time it is not safe given the heightened uncertainty.</p>

<h2>5. Summary</h2>
<p>I introduced the use of <code>Rcpp</code> to improve the efficiency of <code>R</code> analysis. The <code>C++</code> is much faster than <code>R</code> even if you write the code in a simple way, so it is hard to make coding mistakes. Also, even if a compile error occurs, RStudio gives you a clue as to where the compile error is occurring, so there is no stress in that respect either, which is why I recommend it.</p>
