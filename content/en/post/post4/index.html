<p>It’s nice to meet you.
My name is Ayato Ashihara, and I’m a first-year graduate of an asset management company in Tokyo.</p>
<p>I’d like to introduce myself briefly.
I’m 24 years old and graduated from a graduate school.
I majored in macroeconomics, especially DSGE models, state space models, Kalman filters, Bayesian estimation, and MCMC.
I also did some natural language processing as research support for my advisor.
I originally wanted to be an academic researcher, but due to financial problems, I had to find a job.
Now I’m doing menial work in sales support.</p>
<p>I think this blog will be a memorandum of my research hobby as I cannot give up my interest in research.</p>
<p>I am currently working on the following two research projects.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>horse betting version of the factor model</li>
<li>quarterly GDP projection model</li>
</ol>
<p>The first question is whether it is possible to create a model for constructing a horse betting portfolio that aims for a collection rate of over 100%, from the perspective that the horse betting market is more speculatively attractive than the stock market. For stocks, there is a factor model like Pharma French, but I would like to see if we can apply it to create a horse-trading version of the factor model.</p>
<p>Secondly, we are aware of the problem of the low accuracy of the recent preliminary quarterly GDP report, so we wondered if it would be possible to construct a new, highly accurate forecasting model. In particular, I would like to use machine learning to create a model that incorporates data that is not normally used in macroeconomic research, rather than a model based on macroeconomic theory.</p>
<p>We’ve only just begun our research.
I’ll do my best to keep you interested…</p>
<p>Best regards.</p>
